# restApiNodejsExpress
In this project, i have create a simple CRUD REST API using the express nodejs framework with some js concepts like Routees,Controllers,ES6 syntax .Using these rest api, a user can create new user data and add it into the array and can get it through get api. Also the user can delete and update the existing user data using the unique id which is automatically generated using the UUID js package so that every user has a unique id to distinguish among them.Also we can get a specific user based on its unique id.
